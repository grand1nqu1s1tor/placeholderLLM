## **📌 Data Pipeline Overview**

- **Tweets are fetched using Twikit** and stored in **MongoDB**.
- **Change Data Capture (CDC) with MongoDB Change Streams** detects new tweets in real time.
- **Kafka queues process tweet data asynchronously** for scalable downstream processing.

🔹 **Design Considerations**

- Each tweet document is approximately **1KB** in size.
- MongoDB **persists all data on disk** with optimized memory usage.
- Choosing my Embedding model is an important consideration : (https://openreview.net/pdf?id=zl3pfz4VCV)
- Finalizing BAAI/bge-small-en
- Had to use Replica Set setup for MongoDB since Watch Streams aren't supported on Standalone instance.
- Reduced Qdrant Indexing Threshold
- Lowered indexing_threshold to 1 to ensure immediate indexing of vectors instead of waiting for bulk inserts.
  Configured the collection (tweet_embeddings) with 384-dimensional vectors
- I am using a reranking model called rerank-bge-base-en from HuggingFace.
- I need a cron job that keeps the model warm.
